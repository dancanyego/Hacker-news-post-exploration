On average, ask posts in our sample receive approximately 14 comments, whereas show posts receive approximately 10. Since ask posts are more likely to receive comments, we'll focus our remaining analysis just on these posts.

The hour that receives the most comments per post on average is 15:00, with an average of 38.59 comments per post. There's about a 60% increase in the number of comments between the hours with the highest and second highest average number of comments.

According to the data set documentation, the timezone used is Eastern Time in the US. So, we could also write 15:00 as 3:00 pm est.


# Conclusion
In this project, we analyzed ask posts and show posts to determine which type of post and time receive the most comments on average. Based on our analysis, to maximize the amount of comments a post receives, we'd recommend the post be categorized as ask post and created between 15:00 and 16:00 (3:00 pm est - 4:00 pm est).

However, it should be noted that the data set we analyzed excluded posts without any comments. Given that, it's more accurate to say that of the posts that received comments, ask posts received more comments on average and ask posts created between 15:00 and 16:00 (3:00 pm est - 4:00 pm est) received the most comments on average.
